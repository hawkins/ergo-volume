# Ergo Volume

A simple script to allow me to control my media volume from my ErgoDox keyboard,
which lacks media keys.

Currently only supports Windows, because my ErgoDox is only ever hooked up to my
desktop.

## Installation

* Clone the repository
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Add a shortcut to the python file to your Startup folder
  * I.e., `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME_HERE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
    Menu\Programs\Startup`

## Usage

Control your volume with super + page up or page down to turn the volume up and
down respectively for each program.
